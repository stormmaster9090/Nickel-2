Lithium 2 is a continuation of an older Ro-32UI project. All the UI was created but it was never completed and most of it was left untouched.
With Nickel 2 my idea is that plugins can have a standard UI system to use that looks uniform and is easy to use.
Iris and other UI tools exist and although Iris is a great tool, it is fairly difficult to use and I hope that this could be a good middle ground
between difficulty and convenience.
